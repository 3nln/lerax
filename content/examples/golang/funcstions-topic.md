# Golang: Functions Topic

This is a nested topic under the Golang example. If you can read this at `/examples/golang/funcstions-topic`, the nested routing and content lookup work correctly.

- Demonstrates nested content lookup via `examples/**/*.md`.
- Loaded by route params: `exampleId = golang`, `topicId = funcstions-topic`.
